# Commit and Push Django App

1. Commit all changed files with a commit message, that reflects the changes made to the Octofit Tracker Django app. For example: "Update Django app with MongoDB connection, CORS, and API endpoints for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts."
2. If possible, try to use atomic commits that group related changes together. For example, one commit for updating `settings.py`, another for updating `models.py` and `serializers.py`, etc.
3. Push the committed changes to the current branch of the GitHub repository.
